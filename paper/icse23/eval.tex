\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{RQ1)} Can syntactic views express language features or their
    combinations developers desire to understand? (Section~\ref{eval-sview})
  \item \textbf{RQ2)} Does the reachability analysis soundly reduce the number
    of reachable algorithms in ECMA-262, and how many algorithms are reduced?
    (Section~\ref{eval-analysis})
  \item \textbf{RQ3)} How long does the program search engine take time to find
    out the target programs? (Section~\ref{eval-search})
  \item \textbf{RQ4)} Does $\tool$ enhance the understanding of possible
    behaviors of JavaScript language features? (Section~\ref{eval-study})
\end{itemize}
