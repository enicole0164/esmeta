\begin{abstract}\label{sec:abstract}
  JavaScript is a widely-used programming language in diverse fields.  However,
  despite its popularity, developers and even JavaScript experts often suffer
  from its highly dynamic nature and complex semantics.  Thus, when they desire
  to understand the detailed semantics of JavaScript, they refer to ECAM-262, a
  standard JavaScript language specification written in English.  However, it is
  challenging to understand each language feature's possible or impossible
  behaviors by only referring to the specification.  Besides, even if developers
  recognize a specific behavior, finding JavaScript programs that trigger the
  behavior is also not trivial.

  To alleviate this problem, we present $\tool$, which automatically reduces
  JavaScript language specification with a given \textit{syntactic view}.  A
  syntactic view is a way to indicate which language features developers want to
  understand by restricting program syntax and types of evaluation results.
  Then, our tool automatically reduces ECMA-262 so that it consists of only
  abstract algorithms reachable from a given syntactic view.  Our insight is
  that reachable algorithms represent possible behaviors of each language
  feature.  Furthermore, for each algorithm, our tool automatically finds
  example programs that use the selected language feature and the algorithm in
  Test262, an official JavaScript conformance test suite.  We evaluated $\tool$
  with \inred{177} basic syntactic views and the latest ECMA-262 (ES12, 2021),
  including \inred{2,640} algorithms. As a result, our tool reduced ES12 to
  \inred{30.4} algorithms with \inred{42.3} Test262 programs for each algorithm
  in \inred{3.2s} on average.  In addition, we conducted \inred{three} case
  studies with advanced syntactic views to show the practicality of $\tool$.
