  JavaScript is a widely-used programming language in various fields.
  Unfortunately, researchers or language designers often suffer from complex
  semantics in JavaScript. Thus, they make an effort to understand the detailed
  semantics by reading 1) ECMAScript, a JavaScript standard language
  specification written in English, or 2) Test262, an official JavaScript
  conformance test suite.  However, because of the massive specification and
  numerous test programs, it is challenging to localize which specification
  parts or test programs are related to the semantics they want to understand.

  In this paper, we present \textit{syntactic views} to indicate which parts of
  JavaScript semantics users want to understand.  Then, we introduce a novel way
  to 1) reduce language specification for a given syntactic view and 2) search
  and reduce conformance test programs related to each branch in the reduced
  specification.  For evaluation, we developed $\tool$ to actualize our approach
  and experimentally demonstrated its effectiveness with the latest ECMAScript
  (ES12, 2021) and \inred{19,839} conformance test programs in Test262.  For
  \inred{177} basic syntactic views, our tool successfully reduced
  \inred{18.9\%} of steps in \inred{8.4} algorithms on average in ES12 and
  produced \inred{2.3} lines (\inred{152.3} bytes) of a test program for each
  branch in the reduced specification.  Moreover, we performed \inred{three}
  case studies with more advanced syntactic views.
