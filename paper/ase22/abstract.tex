  JavaScript is a widely-used programming language in diverse fields.  Thus,
  many developers and researchers have striven to construct a better development
  environment for JavaScript by developing various tools and techniques.  They
  usually understand the detailed semantics of JavaScript by reading 1)
  ECMA-262, a JavaScript standard language specification written in English, or
  2) Test262, an official JavaScript conformance test suite.  However, since the
  specification and test suite are massive and fast-evolving, it is challenging
  to localize which specification parts or test programs are related to the
  semantics they want to understand.  Moreover, the lack of connection between
  them hinders their synergy for a better understanding of JavaScript semantics.

  In this paper, we first introduce \textit{syntactic views} to help users
  indicate which parts of JavaScript semantics they want to understand.  Then,
  we present an automatic way to 1) reduce the language specification and test
  suite for a given syntactic view and 2) connect each branch in the reduced
  specification to related test programs.  To actualize our technique, we
  developed $\tool$ and evaluated it with the latest ECMA-262 (ES12 or ES2021)
  consisting of \inred{2,640} algorithms, and Test262 consisting of
  \inred{41,415} test programs.  First, we evaluated our tool with \inred{177}
  basic syntactic views.  For each syntactic view, it reduced ES12 and Test262
  to \inred{30.4} algorithms with \inred{18.9\%} reduced steps and \inred{530.2}
  test programs on average, and it found \inred{42.3} test programs related to
  each branch on average.  Besides, we conducted \inred{three} case studies with
  more advanced syntactic views.
