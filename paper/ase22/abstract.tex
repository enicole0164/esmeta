\begin{abstract}\label{sec:abstract}
  JavaScript is a widely-used programming language in diverse fields.  However,
  despite its popularity, developers and even JavaScript experts often suffer
  from its highly dynamic anc complex nature.  Thus, when they desire to
  understand the detailed semantics of JavaScript, they refer to ECMA-262, a
  standard JavaScript language specification written in English.  However, it is
  challenging to understand all the \textit{possible behaviors} of a single or
  combination of language features by only referring to the specification.
  Besides, even if developers recognize a possible behavior of a language
  feature, finding \textit{example programs} that trigger the behavior is also
  not trivial.

  To alleviate this problem, we present $\tool$, which automatically infers
  possible behaviors of JavaScript language features from ECMA-262 and finds
  corresponding example programs in Test262, an official JavaScript conformance
  test suite.  We first introduce \textit{syntactic views} to help users
  indicate which language features they want to understand by restricting
  program syntax with a type bound.  Then, our tool 1) soundly reduces the call
  graph of ECMA-262 with a given syntactic view to infer possible behaviors and
  2) searches concrete example programs in Test262 that trigger such behaviors
  using their pre-collected execution traces.  For evaluation of $\tool$, we
  used the latest ECMA-262 (ES12, 2021), including \inred{2,640} algorithms,
  with \inred{177} basic syntactic views.  As a result, our tool reduced ES12 to
  \inred{109.4} algorithms in \inred{0.8s} and found \inred{42.3} Test262
  programs for each algorithm in \inred{3.2s} on average.  Furthermore, we
  conducted \inred{three} case studies with advanced syntactic views to
  demonstrate the practicality of $\tool$.
