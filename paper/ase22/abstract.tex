  JavaScript is a widely-used programming language in diverse fields.  Thus,
  developers and researchers have presented various language-based tools for
  JavaScript programmers.  For the development of such tools, they have striven
  to understand the detailed semantics of JavaScript by reading 1) ECMA-262, a
  JavaScript standard language specification written in English, or 2) Test262,
  an official JavaScript conformance test suite.  However, since the
  specification and test suite are massive and fast-evolving, it is challenging
  to localize which specification parts or test programs are related to the
  semantics they want to understand.

  In this paper, we present \textit{syntactic views} to help users indicate
  which parts of JavaScript semantics they want to understand.  Then, we
  introduce a novel way to 1) reduce the language specification for a given
  syntactic view and 2) search the conformance test programs related to each
  algorithm step in the reduced specification.  For evaluation, we developed
  $\tool$ to actualize our technique and experimentally demonstrated its
  effectiveness with the latest ECMA-262 (ES12, 2021) and Test262.  For
  \inred{177} basic syntactic views, our tool reduced \inred{18.9\%} of steps in
  \inred{8.4} algorithms of ES12 and showed that only \inred{30.4} test programs
  are related to each branch in the reduced specification on average.  Moreover,
  we performed \inred{three} case studies with more advanced syntactic views.
