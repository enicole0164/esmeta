The code points `/` or any |LineTerminator| occurring in the pattern shall be escaped in _S_ as necessary to ensure that the string-concatenation of *"/"*, _S_, *"/"*, and _F_ can be parsed (in an appropriate lexical context) as a |RegularExpressionLiteral| that behaves identically to the constructed regular expression. For example, if _P_ is *"/"*, then _S_ could be *"\\/"* or *"\\u002F"*, among other possibilities, but not *"/"*, because `///` followed by _F_ would be parsed as a |SingleLineComment| rather than a |RegularExpressionLiteral|.
